You are given a video sequence with camera trajectory data representing the camera's movement through a scene.

The data consists of:
Camera Motion Caption: A basic description of how the camera moves.
Scene Description: A detailed visual summary of the environment.
Camera position data: Three lines, respectively representing the sequence of the camera's x-coordinate, y-coordinate, and z-coordinate.

Your Tasks:

1. Optimized Camera Motion Caption
Generate a refined motion caption **from the perspective of the camera itself**, using only the **camera position data** to determine movement direction and dynamics.

Use the following rules to interpret motion:
  x increasing: camera moves right
  x decreasing: camera moves left
  y increasing: camera moves down
  y decreasing: camera moves up
  z increasing: camera moves forward
  z decreasing: camera moves backward

Analyze the full trajectory over time to capture acceleration, deceleration, or steady motion. Integrate scene context but prioritize accuracy based on numerical data. Avoid vague phrases like "zoom out" unless it's clearly due to focal length change — here, use translation terms instead.

Target Length: 50–100 words

2. Scene Abstract Caption  
Provide a single-sentence summary that captures:  
- Key architectural elements  
- Overall atmosphere/style  
- Notable design features  
Target Length: About 50 words

3. Main Motion Trend Summary  
Summarize the general movement using only 1–3 short motion phrases , depending on how many are clearly present. Focus strictly on major, sustained movements — ignore minor fluctuations or brief directional changes. If only one or two movements dominate, list only those. Use directional translation terms (e.g., forward translate, left translate, upward drift)

4. Scene Keywords  
Extract up to 4 keywords summarizing the key aspects of the scene. Include one term that broadly describes the scene type. Use nouns/noun phrases related to weather, place, time, lighting, scene type. Avoid adjectives/gerunds except for weather. Example: sunset, foggy, marketplace, city street, village

5. Immersive Shot Summary
Blend Optimized Camera Motion Caption and Scene Description evenly — do not focus more on the camera or the scene alone. Describe the visuals as if someone is watching a moving image unfold. Use descriptive, cinematic language that evokes imagery and emotion. Keep it concise but expressive — suitable for use in scripts, storyboards, or AI video/image generation.
