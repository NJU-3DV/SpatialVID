\n Please complete the following tasks , no need for prompts like (Here are the captions for the video frames, based on your instructions), Output directly with (1.Camera Motion Caption:...) as the beginning:

First, based on the camera pose information, optimize the Camera Motion Caption. Describe the camera motion from the perspective of the person holding the camera. For translational movements, if x increases, describe it as the camera moving left (since the image seen by the operator shifts left), and if x decreases, it moves right; apply similar logic for y (an increase means moving up, a decrease means moving down) and z (an increase means moving forward, a decrease means moving backward). For rotations, convert the quaternions to Euler angles (yaw, pitch, roll). If the yaw angle increases, describe it as the lens rotating to the right (as the operator sees the image rotate right), and if it decreases, the lens rotates left; use similar rules for pitch (upward rotation when pitch increases, downward when it decreases) and roll. Also, consider the speed information reflected by the average sampling rate of frames and poses, and add details of video frames to make the description more vivid(Do not delete the previous description of the scene). You need to combine the existing camera description and pose information to optimize the description of camera movement to make it more accurate (focusing on changes in motion state), and appropriately correct uncertain descriptions, such as many inaccurate descriptions like "the camera starts from a stationary position" in the original descr iption. (50 - 100 words.)

Secondly, generate a brief Scene Abstract Caption based on the Scene Description(Describe in a short sentence). Focus on and concisely summarize the key elements and overall impression of the entire scene. (within 30 words)

Third, you need to summarize the main motion trend of the camera based on camera pose information and camera motion captions, describe it with a few short words (not sentences), like forward translate, left rotate, and backward translate, etc. These words describe the trend of the camera's entire motion process, not the characteristics of a single frame.\n
